## 🚀 Quick Start

### Windows

1.  **Double-click `start_ag_phone_connect.bat`**
    The script will:
    - Verify Node.js is installed.
    - Automatically install dependencies (`npm install`) if they are missing.
    - Detect and display your **exact IP Address** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:3000`).
    - Provides a tip to use `install_context_menu.bat` for context menu management.

2.  **Connect Your Phone**
    - Ensure your phone is on the **same Wi-Fi network** as your PC.
    - Open your mobile browser and enter the **URL shown in the terminal**.

3.  **Launch Antigravity** (if not already running)
    - **Recommended**: Run **`install_context_menu.bat`** and select **[1] Install**. Then, simply right-click any project folder and select **"Open with Antigravity (Debug)"**.
    - Otherwise, run manually: `antigravity . --remote-debugging-port=9000`

### macOS / Linux

1.  **Run the launcher script**
    ```bash
    chmod +x start_ag_phone_connect.sh
    ./start_ag_phone_connect.sh
    ```
    The script will:
    - Verify Node.js is installed.
    - Automatically install dependencies.
    - Detect and display your **exact IP Address**.
    - *(Linux only)* Provides a tip to use `./install_context_menu.sh` for Nautilus/GNOME context menu management.
    - *(macOS)* Provide a command to create a fast shell alias (`ag-debug`).

2.  **Connect Your Phone**
    - Ensure your phone is on the **same Wi-Fi network**.
    - Open your mobile browser and enter the **URL shown in the terminal**.

3.  **Launch Antigravity** (if not already running)
    ```bash
    antigravity . --remote-debugging-port=9000
    ```

### macOS: Adding Right-Click "Quick Action" (Optional)

Since macOS requires Automator for context menu entries, follow these steps manually:

1.  Open **Automator** (Spotlight → type "Automator").
2.  Click **File → New** and select **Quick Action**.
3.  At the top, set:
    - "Workflow receives current" → **folders**
    - "in" → **Finder**
4.  In the left sidebar, search for **"Run Shell Script"** and drag it to the right pane.
5.  Set "Shell" to `/bin/zsh` and "Pass input" to **as arguments**.
6.  Paste this script:
    ```bash
    cd "$1"
    antigravity . --remote-debugging-port=9000
    ```
7.  **Save** the Quick Action with a name like `Open with Antigravity (Debug)`.
8.  Now you can right-click any folder in Finder → **Quick Actions → Open with Antigravity (Debug)**.
